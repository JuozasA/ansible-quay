# ansible-quay
Ansible roles &amp; playbooks to install Quay &amp; Clair (Non OpenShift environment).

Based on code of the infra-ansible Red Hat CoP repository: https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible.

A heavy-lifting to the Ansible code to install Quay 3.X. in stand-alone mode. Also to install Clair.

Ansible roles adapted:
  * config-redis
  * config-clair
  * config-postgresql
  * config-docker
  * config-quay-enterprise
